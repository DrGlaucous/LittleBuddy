//Configuration
//this program was built using PlatformIO.
//with some tweaks, it COULD be built using the arduino IDE enviroment. All libraries used in this project are arduino


//this is not really needed, but I have it here for my personal reference. the arduino IDE doesn't like it here, but platformIO doesn't mind
//#ifndef USING_STM32
// Note: this needs to match with the PIN_MAP array in board.cpp
//STM32 pin mapping
//enum {
//    PA0, PA1, PA2, PA3, PA4, PA5, PA6, PA7, PA8, PA9, PA10, PA11, PA12, PA13,PA14,PA15,
//	PB0, PB1, PB2, PB3, PB4, PB5, PB6, PB7, PB8, PB9, PB10, PB11, PB12, PB13,PB14,PB15,
