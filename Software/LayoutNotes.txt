layout and proposition:



have a UI with several tabs:
connect mode
collect mode
basic mode
advanced mode
base mode
terminal mode

none of the tabs will be active unless the connection status is confirmed.
if connection status is lost, screen snaps back to connect mode.

basic mode will have the same features as the original iClicker:
menu for ID, menu for channel, buttons for each answer.


collect mode will have a graph of all sniffed answers and allow the user to make a table of all the clicker IDs (and export it)
will also have an option to send answers out as another collected list, option to move sniffed IDs to this table or add custom ones (also import/export)

will have a whitelist option as well, to ignore ID interception of these clickers

list format

0xIDHERE [tab delim] name maybe? [\n]


advanced mode will be text and buttons only, to look lest conspicuous (collect on/off accessible here too)
will have options like random answer with interval selection (whitelist included)
will have percentages of each answer by sniffed clickers 
option to automatically answer the most popular answer
option to deflect all incoming answers to an answer of choice, or automatically send all answers to the least popular one

base mode
instead of passive gathering
actively send confimration to clickers that they're connected to a base (will remove the "NO BASE" text)
option to export answer counts with question numbers (much like a real base station)

terminal mode
for sending raw commands to the littlebuddy
